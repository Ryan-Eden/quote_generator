# Inspirational Quote Generator
## An inspirational quote generator I built with Codecademy.
This project was a basic console application that allowed me to practice some of the concepts that I had been learning up until this point. 
Some of the things I learned during this process was:
  * How to use the command line setup a project.
  * How to use version control tools such as Git to track and update changes in my program.
